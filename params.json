{"name":"PhenoCam Calibration Tool ","tagline":"characterizing the colour respons of cameras  in the PhenoCam network","body":"# PhenoCam Calibration Tool (PCT)\r\n\r\nPhenoCam Calibration Tool (PCT) is a set of scripts for Linux/Mac OSX and Windows taking care of characterizing the colour respons of cameras installed by or associated with the [PhenoCam network](http://phenocam.sr.unh.edu).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nclone the project to your home computer using the following command (with git installed)\r\n\r\n\tgit clone https://github.com/khufkens/phenocam-calibration-tool.git\r\n\r\nalternatively, download the project using the download button.\r\n\r\nUnzip the downloaded files or use the files cloned by git as is.\r\n\r\n## Use\r\n\r\nThe installation script runs within a terminal on all platforms. To open a terminal search for “Terminal” in OSX spotlight or “cmd” in the program search field (under the Start button) in Windows. For linux users I assume a familiarity with opening a terminal.\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\nOn the command prompt of a terminal the scripts have the same syntax, for Windows script this would be:\r\n\r\n\tPCT.bat IP USER PASSWORD\r\n\r\nYou will need the telnet.exe program to be installed on your computer. As of Windows 7 this isn't installed by default anymore but can still be downloaded from the Microsoft website. Full instructions can be found [here](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc771275%28v=ws.10%29.aspx).\r\n\r\n### Linux / OSX\r\nOn Linux / Mac OSX systems this would read:\r\n\r\n\tsh PCT.sh IP USER PASSWORD\r\nor\r\n\r\n\t./PCT.sh IP USER PASSWORD\r\n\r\nwith:\r\n\r\nParameter     | Description                    \t\r\n------------- | ------------------------------ \t\r\nIP\t      | ip address of the camera \t\t\r\nUSER\t      | user name (admin - if not set) \t\r\nPASSWORD      | user password (on a new Stardot NetCam this is admin) \r\n\r\n[all parameters are required!]\r\n\r\nAn example of our in lab test camera configuration:\r\n\r\n\t./PCT.sh 140.247.89.xx admin admin\r\n\r\nThis runs the calibration script for the camera at the given IP address.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nFor a proper calibration you will need a photo colour checker card (see below) and a stable light source (which does not vary between calibration sessions).\r\n\r\n![colour checker](http://xritephoto.com/images/products/MSCCC_M1.jpg)\r\n\r\nImages should be taken in a location free of interfering light sources (cardboard box).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
